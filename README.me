# Project: Movie Trailer Website

This project creates a website server-side, to display the users favorite movies. The user can click any of the movies, to open a window to view the trailer of the movie

## Technology
* Python
* Bootstrap

## Deploy code
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone this repository to your local drive.
3. In your terminal, cd into the folder of the cloned repository.
4. To create the .html file, to showcase the favorite movies, run `python entertainment_center.py`
5. Go to the folder of the cloned repository and open `fresh_tomatoes.html` in your browser.
6. That's it - have fun! :-)

Install Python
Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a starter code repository that contains a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. To get started, fork this repository to create your own copy in GitHub. Then clone your ud036_StarterCode repository to work on this project locally on your computer. The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.
Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
Notes

The file fresh_tomatoes.py contains the open_movies_page() function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies.
Your task is to write a movie class in media.py. To do this, think about what the properties of a movie are that need to be encapsulated in a movie object such as movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. Look at what open_movies_page() does with a list of movie objects for hints on how to design your movie class.
You’ll want to write a constructor for the movie class so that you can create instances of movie. You can now create a list of these movie objects in entertainment_center.py by calling the constructor media.Movie() to instantiate movie objects. You’ve given movies their own custom data structure by defining the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can be stored in a list data structure. This list of movies is what the open_movies_page() function needs as input in order to build the HTML file, so you can display your website.

To-dos:
* Pep8 style format for all python!
* Produce readme, including:
Include information, such as, how do they get your code (download, etc.), are there any requirements? Are there any commands that need to be run in order to run your application?
If you've never written a README before, Udacity has produced a short course on how to write one effectively.

* Finish this project, today!
